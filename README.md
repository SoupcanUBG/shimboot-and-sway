# dd script       

i have made a small script that makes it easier to use dd by using ./dd and then some flags btw the          
like dashes before matter so the like single dash so ./dd -thing is your user as in /home/user     
mine is toby so it would be for me ./dd -toby then the two dashes so ./dd -toby --thing is your usb path thing      
use lsblk to find your usb and then type it here mine is /dev/sda so it is so far      
./dd -toby --/dev/sda and the final one is your board
